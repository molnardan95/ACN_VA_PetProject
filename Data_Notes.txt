NOTES ABOUT THE DATASET


Inferences:
	- It seems like the player_data is mostly redundant
	- The whole dataset is from 1950. However the 3 point line was implemented from 1980 only. - Filter down to only after that season. We have all stats after that point.
	
	
Potential Improvement: 
	- Download data from https://basketball-reference.com instead (etc: BeautifulSoup from Python link: https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-nba-stats-4b4f8c525994)

	Interesting Analysis of the data. Has some errors when aggregating to player level however. Analysis is taking averages of yearly averages, which is incorrect for obviuos reasons.
	Similar player analysis can be created very easily. That will be OUR FIRST GOAL.
	
	
	
GOALS
	- Find best players using the following dimensions: 
		- points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals (major stats) and field goals, 2-and 3-pointers, career lenght
		- most of these can be broken down into decades/eras and by position, age group
		- 
	- Yearly distribution of these statistics
	
		
	- Really outstanding players in a year/in a position/both
	
	
	- Create Data for 3 aggregation levels (PLAYER, SEASON, TEAM)
	
	
	
CURRENT PROBLEMS
	- PLAYER IDENTIFICATION (There are players with the same name, sometimes even in the same season and team)
	- DATA SORUCING (Our files are static, could use some scraping, this could potentially fix the above as well)
	- SET UP PROJECT COMMUNICATION (TRELLO?)
